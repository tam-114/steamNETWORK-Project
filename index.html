                    <h1 class="display-1">Background</h1>
                    <p>This concept is important because it gives an opportunity for students to make more informed decisions about what they’d like to pursue. It doesn’t replace efforts like internships, mentorship programs, or job shadowing, but it can act as a resource for adding to those efforts and initiatives. For students that want to do more in-depth research into how to work towards their prospective careers and learn more about the ins and outs of the field they’d like to pursue.</p>
                    <p>My current role is as an intern for stemCONNET as a 
                    <a href="https://taystan.dev/stemconnect.html" target="_blank">Workforce Development Intern</a>. This is a child program of the Florida High Tech Corridor, which aims to inspire students to pursue STEM careers from K-12. We do that by hosting virtual connections between classrooms and Experts, where Educators can request for speakers to talk to their classes and give presentations to go more in-depth into topics and give real-life applications, and/or talk about their career journeys and educational paths. This lets students have the chance to ask questions to learn more about different types of careers or to understand a topic better. There are aspects in this project that include those things, but this platform gives more of an asynchronous communication style and not as much of a live webinar focus, with more individual opportunities to explore options, research, and continuous engagement.</p>
                    <p>I’d like to create a platform like this because I’ve joined many groups and organizations, yet rarely have the chance to speak with Experts and professionals about their paths and ask questions that may help others in a questioning situation. Experts can talk about how to network, how to job search in this day and age, give advice on how to stand out in an interview and much more. I have a passion for web design/development, and with my current internship I’ve grown much more of an interest in helping to aid with more educational resources. This platform would hope to serve as a central location for answers from students that aren’t sure what they want to pursue, and the ones that are 100% sure and want to learn more about what’s to come.</p>

                        It can take a couple of weeks to register the company stemNETWORK with an LLC 501(c)(3) and decide on the main features of the site and what type of theme it will have, such as the color scheme, branding, logo, etc. It will also help to have research from similar organizations that promote STEM careers and for social networking.

                        To develop the site, it can take about 2 months with around the clock programming while maintaining a work/life balance. The steamNETWORK.com domain will be obtained and the right hosting service selected that can allow for straightforward upgrading for storage space when there’s more users to the site.

                        Once the site is coming along, around the same time that the domain name is selected, then social media accounts will also be locked in. For example @steamNETWORK will be the consistent name across multiple social media platforms. These would include Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc. These would be established through the month.

                        Through the creation of steamNETWORK, the team will also be applying for grant applications for payments towards the tools used for the site. When there’s a foundation in place, there will also be a kickstarter started to help with the efforts of raising money. It is to be a non-profit limited liability company that mostly operates through grants and fundraising. Donations would be welcomed, but not as a primary form of funding.

                        As steamNETWORK solidifies, the team will expand for more members. These positions can include developers, moderators/recruiters, content writers, social media marketers, etc. The moderators/recruiters role would be to maintain users are following the etiquette of the site, meaning removing uncivil remarks and banning inappropriate behaviors from live webinars, discussions, etc. The moderators will host live webinars, and monitor discussion forums and blog comments. The recruiters will be in charge of outreach for bringing more Experts to the site, and working on creating more organization partnerships. Content writers will be interviewing Experts for blog content, and social media marketers will promote the site and maintain outreach efforts. This can take about a month with interviewing top applicants and onboarding.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Another key aspect of the site will be engagement from students and Educators. Once more Experts become users on the site and content is created with their blogs and facilitating conversation, we will outreach to more students and Educators to build the userbase. It will mainly be via social media, or partnerships with districts to encourage the use of steamNETWORK through schools.
