                    <p><strong>Discussion Forums: </strong>Forums are available for users to submit questions as topics with a title, and they’re able to explain in more detail in the body text. Users can interact with the post and give their insight to questions, saving/bookmarking the discussion, and sharing it. Posts by the original user are included on their profile, as well as comments that are made on any post (similar to Reddit or Quora).</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Blog Posts Comments: </strong>Experts can volunteer or be reached out to to be asked to conduct an “interview”. A member of the steamNETWORK team asks curated questions to the Expert and creates blog posts of their answers. These blog posts introduce the Expert and can be up to 10 or more questions at a time or it can be 3-5 open-ended questions. This is to give insight into their experiences with their career and answer frequently asked questions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Attending Live Webinars: </strong>Live webinars are conducted with a member of the steamNETWORK team that allow for live attendance from interested users as a Q&A segment from Experts. Individual students are welcomed to attend, as well as Educators that request a speaker for specific topics and real-life applications. Webcams/microphones are encouraged for engagement, but steamNETWORK team members may also mute attendees and/or disable webcams for inappropriate behaviors that can result in an account ban.</p>

                    <p><strong>Career Interest Assessments: </strong>Career Interest Assessments can be in-house applications that give insightful questions to provide a range of possible career opportunities that the user may be interested in. There are also many resources available, and the assessment feature may be a curated list of resources for users to take assessments, such as Career One Stop powered by O*NET Interest Profiler.</p>

                    <p><strong>News Feed: </strong>The news feed shows partner organizations’ up-coming events and conferences as organizations are able to upload their flyers/create text-posts and interact with the community on their post. It will also list volunteer opportunities available, and programs that encourage career growth such as internships, mentorships, and job shadowing opportunities in Florida.</p>
